  ‚Ä¢ Passwords are encrypted before storing in the database.
  ‚Ä¢ Forgot Password and Reset Password functionalities are implemented.

  ‚Ä¢ Assign and unassign booths to exhibitors by editing the `exhibitorId` field via update icon.
  ‚Ä¢ Manage exhibitors: view, update, and reject exhibitors using approval icons.
  ‚Ä¢ Manage sessions: add, update, and delete sessions with speaker, topic, time, and location.
  ‚Ä¢ View analytics including booth traffic, session popularity, and overall expo performance.

  ‚Ä¢ Consistent dark mode with CSS variables:
    - `.bg-dark` = #121212 for main background
    - `.bg-dark-custom` = #1e1e1e for cards and sections
    - `.border-purple`, `.btn-purple`, `.table-purple` used across the UI
  ‚Ä¢ Management panels use **dark Bootstrap tables** with **icons** for edit and delete actions (not dropdowns).

  ‚Ä¢ Centralized Axios instance at `src/api/axiosinstance.js` handles all requests.
  ‚Ä¢ API responses follow a consistent format:

      "success": true,
      "key": [...]
    }
